You are a professional food photographer creating hero images for a premium dog food brand called Dogology. The brand is science-driven, warm, and modern.

Photography style:
- Overhead or 45-degree angle shot of a freshly prepared dog meal in a clean ceramic bowl
- Natural daylight, soft shadows, warm color temperature
- Minimal styling: a linen napkin, wooden cutting board, or raw ingredient garnish beside the bowl
- The food should look appetizing, colorful, and clearly home-cooked — not processed kibble
- Background is a clean light wood or white marble surface
- No dogs, no people, no text, no logos in the image
- The ingredients should be visibly identifiable (diced meat, grains, colorful vegetables)
- Shallow depth of field with the bowl in sharp focus

Output: A single photorealistic food photograph, 1024x1024, no borders or frames.

    version: "V1.2",
    summary:
      "The evidence-backed companion to the business model. Grounds every major claim in published research — the 94% deficiency rate in homemade diets, micronutrient under-feeding from calorie restriction, MER formula derivations, AAFCO nutrient profile requirements, human-grade labeling standards, and validation study design. Narrows scope from earlier drafts: finite template recipes (not bespoke formulas), explicit uncertainty bands on MER, phased human-grade claims, and an honest assessment of what is and isn't proprietary. Designed to be stress-tested on specifics.",

			Dogology HealthSpan Kits is a subscription meal‑kit service for dogs that combines canine metabolic
			modeling, USDA‑grade nutrient data, and fully transparent sourcing. Instead of shipping finished dog
			food, it delivers weekly cook‑at‑home kits: precisely portioned human‑grade ingredients plus a custom
			micronutrient premix, generated from each dog’s individual energy and nutrition profile.

		<h2>How it works</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Guardians create a profile (age, weight, body condition, activity, goals, medical flags).</li>
			<li>We calculate MER (maintenance or weight‑change energy requirement) using published canine equations.</li>
			<li>
				A constraint solver formulates recipes that hit kcal/day and protein/fat ranges, satisfy NRC/AAFCO
				micronutrient requirements, and respect constraints like allergens and budget.
			</li>
			<li>
				Each week you receive pre‑measured ingredients + a matched premix + a personalized recipe card with
				gram weights and simple cooking instructions.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Radical transparency</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Every ingredient links to a FoodData Central nutrient profile (surfaced as a “data sheet”).</li>
			<li>Recipe views show per‑ingredient contributions and a full nutrient table vs targets.</li>
			<li>Guardians can inspect the exact MER math and see how changes update the plan over time.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Key differentiators</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Model‑driven</strong>: formulas and constraint logic are visible and explainable.</li>
			<li><strong>Meal kits</strong>: you cook fresh food at home, with micro + macro targets already solved.</li>
			<li><strong>Food‑ and data‑grade</strong>: sourcing + machine‑readable nutrient data for vets and power users.</li>
			<li><strong>Adjusts over time</strong>: updates as weight, body condition, and goals change.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Revenue model</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Subscription plans (weekly or bi‑weekly) with tiers by dog size, dogs per household, and customization.</li>
			<li>Add‑ons: extra premix for fully DIY cooking; specialized protocols (weight‑loss, senior, sport/working).</li>
			<li>Professional tier: co‑branded portal for veterinarians and nutritionists.</li>
		</ul>

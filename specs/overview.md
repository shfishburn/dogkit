**Dogology HealthSpan Kits: Transparent, Vet-Grade Meal Kits for Dogs**  
*Tagline: Science‑Built Food for More Good Years*

Dogology HealthSpan Kits is a subscription meal‑kit service for dogs that combines canine metabolic modeling, USDA‑grade nutrient data, and fully transparent sourcing. Instead of shipping finished dog food, it delivers weekly “cook at home” kits: precisely portioned human‑grade ingredients plus a custom micronutrient premix, all generated from each dog’s individual energy and nutrition profile.

### How It Works

- Guardians create a profile for their dog (age, weight, body condition, activity, goals, medical flags).
- The platform calculates the dog’s **MER** (maintenance or weight‑change energy requirement) using published canine equations and adjustment factors.
- A constraint solver formulates recipes that:
  - Hit the dog’s target kcal/day and protein/fat ranges.
  - Satisfy NRC/AAFCO micronutrient RAs and respect SULs.
  - Respect user constraints (allergens, protein preferences, budget).
- Each week, the customer receives:
  - Pre‑measured raw ingredients (meats, carbs, vegetables, oils).
  - A matched vitamin/mineral premix.
  - A personalized recipe card with gram weights and simple cooking instructions.

### Radical Transparency

- Every ingredient is linked to a **nutrient profile from FoodData Central (or equivalent)**, and those records are surfaced in the UI as “data sheets.”
- The recipe view exposes:
  - Per‑ingredient contributions to calories and each key nutrient.
  - A full nutrient table for the final cooked ration versus NRC/AAFCO targets.
  - Source and provenance metadata (country of origin, producer, certifications).
- Guardians can inspect the **exact MER math** and see how activity, BCS, and weight‑loss goals change daily kcal allocations over time.

### Key Differentiators

- **Model‑driven, not marketing‑driven**: formulas and constraint logic are visible and explainable, similar to Dogology’s human HealthSpan calculator.
- **Meal kits, not finished food**: customers cook fresh food at home, with the assurance that micro‑ and macronutrient targets are already solved.
- **Food‑ and data‑grade** transparency: ingredient sourcing plus machine‑readable nutrient data, suitable for both vets and power users.
- **Adjusts over time**: as weight, body condition, or goals change, the MER and recipe formulations auto‑update, and future kits reflect the new targets.

### Revenue Model

- **Subscription plans** (weekly or bi‑weekly):
  - Pricing tiers based on dog size, number of dogs, and level of customization.
- **Add‑ons**:
  - Extra nutrient premix for fully DIY cooking.
  - Specialized protocols (weight‑loss, senior, sport/working dogs) with more frequent MER re‑assessment.
- **Professional tier**:
  - White‑label or co‑branded portal for veterinarians and nutritionists to prescribe and monitor custom kits for patients.
